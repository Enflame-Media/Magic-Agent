# Happy Android App

This folder is reserved for the native Android client.

Planned foundations:
- Gradle project under `apps/mobile/android/`
- Kotlin application source in `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/`
- Shared assets under `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/res/`

Notes:
- Keep this app standalone from the Vue web workspace.
- Align shared protocol usage with `packages/schema/protocol`.
