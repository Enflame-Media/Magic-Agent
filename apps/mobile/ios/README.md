# Happy iOS App

This folder is reserved for the native iOS client.

Planned foundations:
- Xcode project under `apps/mobile/ios/Happy.xcodeproj`
- Swift/SwiftUI application source in `apps/mobile/ios/Happy/`
- Shared assets under `apps/mobile/ios/Assets/`

Notes:
- Keep this app standalone from the Vue web workspace.
- Align shared protocol usage with `packages/schema/protocol`.
